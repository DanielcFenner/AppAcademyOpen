# Design Notes

## Instagram

Lot's of space, doesn't feel overwhelming. Gets straight to the point. Only thing is text looks a bit small on the input form.

## Craigs List

Overwhelming amount of links. Looks old and scares me away.

## Github

Beautiful website that gives you a lot if info without overwhelming you at any point in time. Leads you through each section with clean graphics and very readable font. Good use of color without being overbearing.

## Reddit

Gets straight to the content, no messing around.

## Paul Graham

Site looks like it was made in the 90s, text is tiny. button bevels are old, colors are old.

## Supreme

Text is tiny. They're trying to do something unique and cool, but it's kinda just annoying to use since it operates so different ot any other website.
